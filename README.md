## Spotify Interview questions

This repo is created to store the Spotify New York City Technology Fellowship Program technical questions

### Question 1 - sortString(s,t)

sortString was implemented by creating a hash map, storing the amount of times a letter appears. which then follows the order of string(t).
Hash map allows for O(1) lookup time, and the loop through string(t) is O(n)

### Question 2 - decodeString(s)

Question 2 was implemented with recursion, breaking down the question to smaller subsections to evaluate the [] bracket, duplicating the string.

### Question 3 - changePossibilites(amount, denominators)

Question three was implemented in a way that generated all possible ways to get any integer lower than amount up to 0. (Using leftovers as a way to check for possibilities)
